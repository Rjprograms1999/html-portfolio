<h1>The Best Movies According to Abdullah</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Animal</h3>
<p>
  <em> It's the most recent indian movie i have watched. It's all about violence where ranbir kapoor acts as the hero. Overall the movie is really great to watch but at the same time it can have a negative influence towards the youth as well </em>

<h3>Bala</h3>
<p>
  <em> Its one of the best indian movie that i have watched recently as it targets the audience insecurities that they have to face in their day to day lives. It tells about the markets and gimics used to shatter the confidence of such individuals by giving them false hope just for promoting their goods rather than giving them a mmessage of accepting themselves as they are. I believe such movies are worth lifetime to watch and will have a very positive impact on our youth. </em>

<h3>Zindagi Na Miley Gi Dobara</h3>
<p>
  <em> Another great indian movie that has a very good lesson related with our day to day lives. Here Hrithik Roshan acts as the hero and he lives a normal boring life working 9 to 5 working his ass off to be millionaire and somehow manages to achieve it but deep inside he is truly unhappy because even after achieving all his goals and desires he is still unsatisified and needs fulfillment and this is where comes a girl as his life saviour to show him about the sweetness of life that he has been missing lately and gives him a good lesson about enjoying every moment rather than continious grind and makes himself miserbale. This movie can also have a very positive impact towards the audience as it's mostly closely related to their day to day lives. </em>
